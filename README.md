# Flyerfold

Flyerfold is a microblogging and media-sharing social network that respects how people get along in real life.


## Key Points

You only see messages from others that you follow.

You can choose to all of someone's messages, or only messages on topics that you choose.

Flyerfold is designed _not_ to addict users.  There are no game-like metrics or other reinforcement mechanisms.

On the technical side, Flyerfold's design can work as a centralized service, a federated service, or a peer-to-peer application.


## Licensing

The author has not yet decided how to license Flyerfold.  The plan is to make it available under a strong copyleft license with additional protections for user rights.
